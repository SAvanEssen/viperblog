This blog I created mid-november 2019 and was my first attempt at creating a CRUD and RESTful-routed app. It was partly a code-along with Colt STeele's Webdeveloper Bootcamp on Udemy and partly my own interpretation. This was also my first introduction to Semantic UI, before I only used CSS and Bootstrap for styling. It gave me a nice chance to experiment a little with styling outside plain CSS and Bootstrap. No authentication and authorization yet, also not hosted online yet. That is a goal for the new blog I am currently coding, which for now I plan to host on Heroku.
